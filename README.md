... and many more to come! It's very simple to contribute by opening a PR with your files, and a few minutes finding and parsing the right URL could help more than you might expect.

### How to use
`wallpaper-learn` can be run straight from the terminal, assuming that you have navigated to the directory where the file resides. From there, it takes a few simple arguments in order to find out which topic + subtopic you are interested in, and then creates a `pictures` folder which houses all of the images.

Once the command has finished running, all that you have to do is navigate to your settings/System Preferences and set up a cycling wallpaper background (images below for Macintosh and Windows).
